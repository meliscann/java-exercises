ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
Java
Scanner for user input

question1: Password Validator
This project implements a password validation program in Java that checks whether a given password meets specific criteria. The password must be at least 8 characters long, contain only letters and digits, and include at least two digits.

ðŸŽ® Features
Validates if the password is at least 8 characters long.
Checks that the password contains only letters and digits.
Ensures the password includes at least two digits.

question2: Sum Series Calculator
This Java program calculates and prints the sum of a mathematical series where each term is represented as i/(i+1), for i ranging from 1 to 20. The program uses floating-point division to ensure accurate results.

ðŸŽ® Features
Computes the series sum for values of i from 1 to 20.
Demonstrates floating-point division to avoid integer division errors.
Outputs the result for each term and the cumulative sum.

question3: Reverse Number
This Java program takes a user-inputted number and prints its reversed version. It demonstrates the use of loops and arithmetic operations to reverse the digits of a number.

ðŸŽ® Features
Reverses a given integer.
Displays the reversed number as output.

question4: Sum of Digits
This Java program calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It demonstrates how to extract individual digits using modulo and division, and sum them to get the result.

ðŸŽ® Features
Takes a number input from the user.
Computes the sum of the digits of the number.
Displays the calculated sum as output.

question5: String Sorter
This Java program takes a string input from the user and sorts its characters in ascending order. The program uses basic string manipulation techniques to sort the string alphabetically.

ðŸŽ® Features
Takes a string input from the user.
Sorts the characters of the string in alphabetical order.
Displays the sorted string as output.

question6: List Input
This Java program prompts the user to enter a series of numbers and stores them in an array. It demonstrates how to dynamically collect user input and store it in an array for further processing.

ðŸŽ® Features
Asks the user how many numbers they want to enter.
Collects and stores the numbers in an array.
Displays each entered number.
