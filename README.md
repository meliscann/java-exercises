### ➗ **question2: Sum Series Calculator**
This Java program calculates and prints the sum of a mathematical series where each term is represented as `i/(i+1)`, for `i` ranging from 1 to 20. The program uses floating-point division to ensure accurate results.

#### 🎮 Features:
- Computes the series sum for values of `i` from 1 to 20.
- Demonstrates floating-point division to avoid integer division errors.
- Outputs the result for each term and the cumulative sum.

### 🔄 **question3: Reverse Number**
This Java program takes a user-inputted number and prints its reversed version. It demonstrates the use of loops and arithmetic operations to reverse the digits of a number.

#### 🎮 Features:
- Reverses a given integer.
- Displays the reversed number as output.

---

### ➕ **question4: Sum of Digits**
This Java program calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It demonstrates how to extract individual digits using modulo and division, and sum them to get the result.

#### 🎮 Features:
- Takes a number input from the user.
- Computes the sum of the digits of the number.
- Displays the calculated sum as output.

---

### 🔠 **question5: String Sorter**
This Java program takes a string input from the user and sorts its characters in ascending order. The program uses basic string manipulation techniques to sort the string alphabetically.

#### 🎮 Features:
- Takes a string input from the user.
- Sorts the characters of the string in alphabetical order.
- Displays the sorted string as output.

---

### 📜 **question6: List Input**
This Java program prompts the user to enter a series of numbers and stores them in an array. It demonstrates how to dynamically collect user input and store it in an array for further processing.

#### 🎮 Features:
- Asks the user how many numbers they want to enter.
- Collects and stores the numbers in an array.
- Displays each entered number.
